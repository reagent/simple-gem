= SimpleGem

== Description

Creating RubyGems is fun work, but dealing with the complexity of hoe / bones / newgem is not (for me, at least).  SimpleGem is a way to quickly create a gem structure with the bare minimum needed to build and deploy. 

== Installation

    $ sudo gem install simple-gem
        
== Usage

    $ simple-gem my-gem
    
This will create a gem structure under the 'my-gem' directory.  The command is pretty forgiving with the name you supply, it will automatically transform anything that is camelcased into something more ruby-like.

After generating your gem, go ahead and add information about your gem to both the <tt>Rakefile</tt> and <tt>README.rdoc</tt> files.  The default version number is "0.1.0", but if you want to change that, take a look at <tt>lib/my_gem/version.rb</tt> to make the change - this will automatically be picked up when you rebuild your gem.

Your new gem provides some Rake tasks for convenience:

* <tt>rake gem</tt> - Build the gem and drop it into the <tt>pkg/</tt> directory for installation.
* <tt>rake test</tt> - The default test task, it will run the tests in <tt>test</tt>. If this is a newly-created gem, your tests will flunk.
* <tt>rake coverage</tt> - If RCov is installed on your system, this will run all tests and report coverage.  This replaces the default test task.
* <tt>rake console</tt> - Loads a console with lib/gem_name. Useful for debugging.

That's it. Enjoy.
